This project has some severe limitations because I'm just starting out learning about passwordless. For example, you can rerun the register function with the same data, you can't login on several devices, etc. 

The next step that I've done is [https://github.com/mewhhaha/remix-passwordless-durable](https://github.com/mewhhaha/remix-passwordless-durable) where it's a bit more proper but you probably shouldn't assume it's working correctly.
